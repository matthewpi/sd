## Features

- systemd notify - `sd_notify` (`Type=notify` and `Type=notify-reload`)
  - Allows applications to notify systemd about it's status, useful for ensuring systemd knows when a service actually starts or indicating status details.
  - Support for watchdogs to ensure applications are still alive, similar to a
    Kubernetes readiness probe.
- systemd sockets
  - Allows applications to bind to privileged ports without privileges.
  - Support for socket-activation to allow applications to be started automatically when an incoming connection comes in.
  - Simplifies binding to unix sockets as an application doesn't need special
    logic to handle it, instead just binds to a listener, the same as if a port
    was being used.
